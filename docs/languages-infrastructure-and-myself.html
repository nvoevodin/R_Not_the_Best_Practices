<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> Programming languages and R’ place among them</h2>
<div id="r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.1</span> R</h3>
<p>If you are new to programming and if you are reading this book you probably are, then explaining to you that R is a functional language and Java is an object oriented language will not make any sense to you or just will not be useful. Instead, I just want to write a few words here about how I see the R universe, and how it touches other languages. I will definitely not cover all the languages, not even close, and I might not even be hundred percent accurate all the time. However, I will cover everything that I think you will need to start with R and to get to a decent level. The goal here is to make sure you have an overall understanding of the environment you will be working in. I want to make sure that you retain as much information as possible, therefore, I will not be stuffing your brain with information that you do not need at the moment or will not need any time soon. Once you feel comfortable with your level, obviously, go ahead and learn some advanced geek stuff about different languages, and who and how and why built them.</p>
<p>First of all, R is an open-source (free) programming language that focuses on working with data, statistical computation, and graphical visualization. It is widely used by academics, statisticians, data miners, and big data companies to work with all sorts of information. Just to give you a perspective of how popular it is in its field, here is a list of 10 largest R users:</p>
<div class="infobox sage" data-latex="{sage}">
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>Airbnb</li>
<li>IBM</li>
<li>HP</li>
<li>Ford</li>
<li>New York Times</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Some of these might not exist when you are reading this (UBER lol). These companies use R for things like behavior analysis, data forecasting, various advanced visualizations and statistical modeling. We will not be doing those things, but it is good to know that the language that you are using is popular with some big names.</p>
<p>Secondly, R is different from most other languages because of how it works with data. That is its main advantage and appeal. The way I see it is represented in the following diagram:</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="trash.png" alt="Important Diagram." />
<p class="caption">Important Diagram.</p>
</div>
</center>
</div>
<div id="excel" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.2</span> Excel</h3>
<p>You are, probably, familiar with Excel and know what an excel table looks like. When you will start working with R, you will notice that you are also working with tables most of the time. Just like in excel. Well, you will probably think that tables like that are supported by every language, for example JavaScript, Java, PHP and other big ones. You would be wrong. These languages do not work with data like Excel or R. Simple operations like joining two tables and aggregating them somehow, that would take two or three lines of code in R, will require some substantial coding and time in those languages, especially if you are new. But how DO those languages work with data? It is definitely possible, however, they are just not made for that. Most of the time, these languages connect to SQL database and use SQL language to work with tabular data. You do not need to worry about that right now. All you need to remember is that R is designed to work with data, and you will be much more efficient using R compared to the languages mentioned above. But what about these other languages in the diagram? Well, we have already covered Excel.</p>
</div>
<div id="stata-spss-and-sas" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.3</span> STATA, SPSS, and SAS</h3>
<p>STATA, SPSS, and SAS are powerful but outdated and expensive statistical packages that also work with tabular data just like excel and R. They are not programming languages and unless you want to find yourself hungry crawling on the floor looking for rats to eat in your studio that you share with some unemployed actor, because nobody wants that shit, I would recommend to stay away from them.</p>
</div>
<div id="python" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.4</span> Python</h3>
<p>Finally, Python is a full fledged general purpose programming language. It is very hot right now and it seems like every homeless guy knows it already. That, plus the fact that Python is not specifically built to work with data makes me think that a combination of R with something like JavaScript makes more sense. Do not get me wrong, Python is a great and powerful language and is really dominating R at the moment. I used both and found R easier to set up and start working with. To put it simply, Python tries to mimic what R does natively by creating additional packages that are just not as powerful. Pythonistas might dispute that but if you are reading this, I im assuming that you have made you choice, at least for the moment, and im just trying to confirm that you were right.</p>
</div>
<div id="diagram-and-related-languages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.5</span> Diagram and Related Languages</h3>
<p>So, to sum this up, if you look at the diagram again from right to left:</p>
<div class="infobox note" data-latex="{note}">
<p>Excel is a point and click tool and you should only use it for some final touches sometimes; STATA, SPSS, and SAS are the bottom of the barrel and you should stay away from them; and R and Python are both programming languages and you can not be wrong picking either.</p>
</div>
<p>This was an overview of what R is and how it compares to some other similar and not so similar languages. Right now, though, we do not need to know anything else about them, because we will not be interacting with any of those for the first half of the book at least. Next, I would like to talk about the languages that we WILL be actively communicating with throughout this book and after.</p>
<p>There are four languages that we will be interacting with throughout this book. Do not get scared here though as they will be introduced very slowly and you should have no problems understanding what is going on at the stage of the book when we will be introducing them. I will tell you right now that these languages are called SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, if you never heard of them, do not start googling them as you do not need them at the moment. Maybe, google SQL, but thats it. By the time you are finished with this book, you will have a some understanding of SQL. CSS, HTML and JavaScript will be introduced in the next books. However, I will still explain what they all do in this chapter. That will serve you well as an entry point to these languages should you decide to branch out beyond R.</p>
</div>
<div id="sql" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.6</span> SQL</h3>
<p>Lets start with SQL. One of the things that you will be doing almost every day is interacting with a database or databases. I know, because that is what I have been doing since the second day at my R-requiring job. That is what I am still doing today and that is what I will be doing for as long as I am programming in any language. Here is a brief intro to SQL. SQL is sort of a programming language, but it really is not. It is a language that you will use to interact with databases.</p>
<div class="infobox caution" data-latex="{caution}">
<p>You can not really avoid using SQL as it is the only way to get or add data from or to a database, and if there is another way that I do not know about, then you do not need to know about it at the moment either, because it is definitely some bullshit way that nobody uses or will ever use. Just remember, SQL is your language for database interaction. SQL is important, and the best thing about it is that it is quite easy to pick up, at least the basics.</p>
</div>
<p>SQL is quite easy. Obviously, there is a bunch of complicated and advanced stuff that you can do with SQL, but you will not need that now. Instead, we will do some very simple pulls in SQL and compliment it with some R language to clean and aggregate our data. After you finish the book and build a few small apps requiring some basic SQL, you will obviously spread your wings and learn some advanced SQL, but that will be later.</p>
<p>So, that was SQL. If you are really new, just like I was a couple of years ago, you also want to know what is a database and why do we need it.</p>
<div class="infobox tip" data-latex="{tip}">
<p>A database is just that, a data storage where you keep all kinds of information in a form of tables. Imagine an Excel table.</p>
</div>
<div class="infobox warning" data-latex="{warning}">
<p>If you can’t imagine an excel spreadsheet, then you should really take some pre-requisites before continuing.</p>
</div>
<p>Well, database is just a collection of such tables. Why cant we just use an excel file for our data storage needs? We could, but an excel table can only hold a little more than a million of records before it fucks up. Imagine that you are running a store that sells 1 million bananas every day. You will have to create a new spreadsheet every day just to keep your banana selling records. What if you are also selling some rifles. Your records will go out of hand very quickly and you will start losing a lot of information, and instead of paying attention to your weird banana/rifle selling business, you will be worrying about your excel spreadsheets not opening. Databases solve that problem. They are built specifically to store virtually infinite number of bananas and rifles records. On top of that, databases are fast, and SQL language makes working with them easy. So, remember, for a lot of data (millions of rows) we are using databases and SQL. You can still, and we will, use an excel type of file to do some small jobs and share them via emails and so forth, nothing wrong with that. That is about all you need to know about SQL and databases at the moment. Lets cover HTML/CSS/JavaScript next.</p>
</div>
<div id="about-htmlcssjavascript" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.7</span> About HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets. Fancy, right? CSS is not really a programming language, it is a styling language. Every color, every curved line, sliding panel, animation, and all the fancy stuff that you see when you browse the internet or use apps, is styled using CSS, or at least some implementation of CSS. I mentioned that CSS is not a programming language. It is instead a part of the family of three languages, HTML/CSS/JavaScript. You have probably heard of these or at least of some of these. Basically, these three power the modern internet. Nearly 100% of what you see when opening your browser is these languages. They DO work with other languages to do some stuff behind the scenes like shopping carts, statistics, machine learning, etc, but, generally, whatever you see in front of you is a some combination of these three languages.</p>
<div class="infobox note" data-latex="{note}">
<p>To cement it in your head, I want you to think about these languages as a sentence structure. HTML is a noun, it defines the object. The object being a web page. So, HTML creates a web page, just an empty skeleton, no colors, no pop ups, no styling, nothing really works yet. All you are seeing are some text, some buttons, drop downs maybe, unformatted pictures but they are not really doing anything yet. Hopefully, you see the picture. If not, check out the one below.</p>
</div>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="jshtmlcss.png" alt="JS/HTML/CSS as a sentence." />
<p class="caption">JS/HTML/CSS as a sentence.</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>CSS in this setup is the adjective, in other words, it describes the noun just like CSS adds colors, lines, animation, and other visuals to that empty web page that we just created with HTML. At this point we have a nicely styled web page that doesnt really do much, which you can get away with in some cases. Below is one of the Amazon pages. You can sometimes experience the view on the right when, lets say, you lose internet connection. A server, first, loads the structure of a page and then applies the css. So, below, the unstyled page is on the right and styled on the left.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="csshtml.png" alt="Html ith and without CSS." />
<p class="caption">Html ith and without CSS.</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>However, if you want your website or your app to actually do something, you are going to need JavaScript. JavaScript in this setup is the verb that defines the actions of the page that we have just made with HTML and styled with CSS. A simple example of what JavaScript does in combination with the other two is the following:</p>
<div class="infobox note" data-latex="{note}">
<p>HTML creates a button; CSS makes it blue and its text white and adds animation to it when it is clicked; JavaScript makes sure that when you click that button something happens, a plot is generated or a set of data is printed, or some calculation is happening and the result is shown on the screen.</p>
</div>
<p>Hopefully, this paints a clear picture about this family of languages and about how they interact with each other and with you.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-the-htmlcssjavascript-in-this-book." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.8</span> using the HTML/CSS/JavaScript in this book.</h3>
<p>We are definitely not going to touch any of these in the first book. You will be learning the fundamentals of R and will not be creating any web pages or web apps that would require styling or interactivity. You will start seeing some CSS styling starting with the second book, where we will start introducing you to the R library for creating web apps called ‘Shiny’.</p>
<p>The third and forth books will mostly revolve around ‘Shiny’ and web apps, and that is where we will be using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Fortunately, ‘Shiny’ is HTML/CSS/JavaScript wrapped in one thing, and that is its beauty. Using ‘Shiny’, you do not need any prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Everything is wrapped for you in the nice package, and the only things that you need to worry about is the data, logic, and functionality of your app. Having said that, ‘Shiny’ does limit you to its built-in styles and functionality. There are many auxiliary libraries surrounding ‘Shiny’ that expand its functionality and that is great, however, sometimes, it will not be possible to find exactly what we will be going for, and that is where we will be needing lots of CSS and a little bit of HTML and JavaScript. I want to tell you ahead of time that we will not be doing a lot of HTML and JavaScript. We will use these two here and there in a form of tricks and hacks to make our apps look cool, but not more than that. The majority of our customization will be done using CSS. So, do not sweat researching HTML and JavaScript, you will not need any knowledge to keep up when we will be using it.</p>
<p>To sum up: we will focus on R fundamentals and some SQL at first. In the later books, as we move into web applications and start using ‘Shiny’ library, we are going to introduce some CSS; and once we move deeper and get better, we will be using much more CSS and will be adding some HTML and JavaScript hacks and tricks to make our apps amazing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="about-infrastructure" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.4</span> About Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Apart from R itself, ‘Shiny’ tools, SQL, and the side languages mentioned in the previous section, there is infrastructure. Infrastructure is everything that makes the production and consumption of your product possible.</p>
<div class="infobox caution" data-latex="{caution}">
<p>Infrastructure is very important. The infrastructure that we will be covering in this and later books will include database and storage options, hosting options, API calls, optimization, and some other tools like docker and electron, which also fall under the category of infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div id="databases" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.4.1</span> Databases</h3>
<p>We have already covered some ground on databases and SQL. However, there is a second side to databases, actually building your own database. In that scenario, you are serving as a data engineer providing infrastructure for yourself or for others. I will teach you to do that in the next books. You will use our database in this book. But I am jumping ahead right now, you dont need to worry about this now, and we will have a deeper dive into this topic somewhere in the third book.</p>
</div>
<div id="hosting" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.4.2</span> Hosting</h3>
<p>Imagine that you have just built your first app. It is now on your computer and you can play with it. Very cool, except, nobody else can really see it besides you. Your app has to live somewhere else besides your computer, and hosting accomplishes just that. Hosting lets you release your product to the public. Same applies to web sites and databases by the way. Good news is that there are free options for your hosting and you can even set up your own hosting straight from your home computer. Hosting and databases go hand in hand and will be two most important infrastructure topics in the following books. Other things will kind of revolve around these two.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-tools" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.4.3</span> Other tools</h3>
<p>In the fourth book, we will start introducing more advanced concepts and tools like api calls, dockerized apps, optimization and some others. Even though I called these tools advanced, it doesnt mean that they are hard. In fact, they are much easier to pick up once you are ready. The reason they are in the advanced category is that you must first learn all the things that I have been talking about up until now before you even need to know what these ‘advanced’ things do, purely because you just do not need them in the beginning.</p>
<p>That was our brief introduction into the topic of infrastructure. The coolest thing about infrastructure is that it, maybe, sounds boring at first. You are thinking, ‘I just want to create something cool. And apps are what I and everybody see and that is why it is cool.’</p>
<div class="infobox note" data-latex="{note}">
<p>Well, my answer to you is, ‘You will be surprised’. You will be surprised by how exiting it is to build your own database for the first time, connect to it, load and pull some data, and for all this to work. Or to set up your hosting, put your app there and open it from your phone and start sending that shit to your friends to brag. You will see, just like I did!</p>
</div>
<p>All I am saying is do not assume that ‘back-end’ (nerd’s term for the infrastructure that we are talking about now) is something boring or something you do not want to be doing. I can almost guarantee that once you built your first few apps and showed them to people, you will be more exited to talk about the stuff behind that app, the stuff that makes it run. The picture in front of peoples’ eyes (‘front-end’) will become a ‘noob’ stuff at that point.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="about-me" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.5</span> About Me</h2>
<p>In this section, I think, I am trying to relate to you, a person with no computer science degree. It is a general idea that coding is hard. And what I say to this is, ‘It is absolutely CORRECT’. Coding is incredibly hard and all those asshole pretend gurus on youtube that say ‘learn xyz language in 20 minutes or 5 hours or 1 month’ are fucking lying. Those videos are click baits and they will not teach you shit. It will take you at least 4-5 months of consistent everyday work to get to the initial comfort level.</p>
<p>Now, having said all that downbeat stuff, I want to assure you that you do not need a computer science degree to become a professional software engineer or a data engineer or a database engineer. I do not hold a computer science degree, yet, I have been quite successful at this and feel qualified to teach you this stuff. But what about those people who went to school for this?</p>
<div class="infobox caution" data-latex="{caution}">
<p>First of all, you should only worry about your own skill as there will always be better programmers than you. So what? The demand for coding specialists will only increase and there will never be enough people who programmed since kindergarten. That is where YOU come in. Secondly, what do you think kids at college do? At best, if they are full-time, they go to school twice a week, take two coding classes at best (A WEEK), then some other two useless classes like underwater poetry and hipster studies just to graduate. After that, they go home and jerk off for the rest of the week or play video games or both. Only a minority will actually commit an appropriate amount of time to learning code. What do you think they know in the end? Obviously, they are going to have some fancy resume that will say something like Python, C++, JavaScript, PHP, blablabla. But when you sit them down and ask to build something, they will be lost a lot of times. It is not to say that there is much wrong with learning at the job, it is just I do not want you to operate under assumption that you are so far behind that it is impossible to catch up.</p>
</div>
<p>I recently watched a documentary about hackers and companies guarding against them. In that documentary they showed unpaid guys in their hoodies, hacking and learning from home every day, almost all day, way past nine to five with real commitment and intent, just for fun. At the same time, they show a private company with a bunch of college graduates-programmers struggling to prevent their clients from hacker attacks. You can see all that nice equipment, interactive maps, and so forth. But they still lose to those hackers a lot of times. Why is that? The reason is dedication. I am sure there are exceptions, but just like with college students, majority of employees are there nine to five, they will take any break possible and are really looking forward to that day to fucking end or to accumulate enough vacation days to get the fuck out for a while. The hacker bro, on the other hand, sits there and learns relentlessly about some new cool way to fuck someone up. You would say, ‘but he is outnumbered’.</p>
<div class="infobox caution" data-latex="{caution}">
<p>In programming, you are only as good as the number of hours that you have coded, not the number of degrees you got or years you have spent to get them. That hacker does not need to spend more hours programming than the whole team of that company combined, just more than their best programmer. In that situation, it is like a case of zero multiplied by any number is still zero. If that hacker is much better than their best person, he will run circles around them and they wont be able to do much. This little story is just my way to cement something in your head. Unlike medical or legal fields, in coding, you are only as good as your code. And the only way to improve is to code. Certificates alone will not get you very far.</p>
</div>
<p>So, what makes me say with confidence that you do not need a degree to succeed at this, and moreover, what makes me qualified to teach you all these things. Well, this many pages into this book, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Nikita Voevodin, I am a professional data analyst and software developer with concentration in interactive visualizations and database setup. I spent the last half of the decade doing legislative, budget, policy, and data analysis for New York City and New York State. My work involved developing and automating big data processes, building and interacting with databases, creating apps and dashboards for my superiors and public, as well as conducting high level research to empower legislation in the area of city transportation. I hold three separate degrees, BS in economics, BA in political science, and MPA in public policy. As you can see, I do not hold a degree in computer science or anything related. In fact, apart from having a PC since I was 9 and using it mostly for games, and learning some excel in college, I had no coding background of any kind. I never even knew anybody who coded. This book is the chronological representation of my progress from zero to the quite high level of proficiency. Now, what makes me qualified to teach you? Ultimately, you will be the judge of that, but I would also like to list some of my portfolio items in R. First, I went from knowing practically nothing about programming to doing some advanced stuff within a year. Secondly, I am an author or co-author of R Shiny apps like:</p>
<div id="tlc-datahub" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.1</span> TLC DataHub</h3>
<p>The ‘Hub’ as I call it, is by far the most complete and advanced thing that I created. It is used by hundreds of users every day and is listed on the font page of the Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission of New York City. Here is the intro about it:</p>
<div class="infobox tip" data-latex="{tip}">
<p>“TLC Data Hub offers users a new and convenient location to access and visualize taxi and for hire industry data. TLC Data Hub uses public data available on NYC Open Data and the TLC website and does not use, track or display any private information of the drivers or companies. The Hub currently consists of two dashboards. The ‘Trip Viz’ dashboard allows the public to run queries on TLC-collected trip data while the ‘Industry metrics’ dashboard provides standard visualizations of monthly industry trends.”</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.2</span> TLC VIN Decoder</h3>
<p>The decoder is a utility app that utilizes the NHTSA api to give you a lot of useful information about either a single vehicle or a list of vehicles that you pass into it. It is used by the Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission of New York City to keep track of electric vehicles, for example.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.3</span> TLC DataMeetup App</h3>
<p>I am or used to be a host of monthly data meetups at TLC. TLC Data Meetup is or was a venue where employees interested in technology would come together to share ideas, tips, and tricks in relation to technology and their research. Me and my manager Fausto Lopez created the following app to streamline processes of registration and presentation.</p>

<p>Components from these apps will become the base for this and the following books. Finally, I have built databases, countless algorithms, and have completed multiple large data analysis projects for different agencies within the City of New York. Most importantly, I taught all these things to myself, I have clear understanding of what it is like to start from scratch, and I have a vision of how a completely new to programming person should start learning code.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.4</span> Flow of This Book</h3>
<p>As I said before, coding is mostly dry and dull subject for most people. My goal, therefore, is to keep your attention and interest for as long as possible. Besides bad words and seasoned jokes, I decided to add an element of a strory telling. The story will not be present everywhere, because there are some basics that we just must run through. However, I will try to keep the whole thing in the boundaries of the story, which, in the first book, is based on my first three - four months of learning R. Lets go.</p>
